# Release build

Create a local keystore outside version control, then supply its path and secrets as Gradle properties:

```bash
./gradlew \
  -PINSTINCTAZERO_STORE_FILE=/absolute/path/instinctazero-release.keystore \
  -PINSTINCTAZERO_STORE_PASSWORD='…' \
  -PINSTINCTAZERO_KEY_ALIAS=instinctazero \
  -PINSTINCTAZERO_KEY_PASSWORD='…' \
  assembleRelease
```

The resulting APK is `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`. The signing key is required for every future update; keep it backed up and never commit it.
